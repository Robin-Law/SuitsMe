A C# kata on cards and their positions

## What is this?
A little coding exercise for fun and little-to-no profit.

## What does it do?
It has a couple of models for Playing Cards and Decks, and a couple of extension methods that Order and Shuffle the cards. It has tests.

## What did you learn?
* Shuffling cards with a naive algorithm is no fun, and testing it is even less fun.
  * A simple order-by over a practically random generator is a wayyyyy cleaner way to do it. Thanks Coding Horror.
